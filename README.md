TITLE: FACIAL EMOJI GENERATION BASED ON FACE EMOTIONS:
Project descrption:

Facial emoji generation based on emotions is the process of creating digital face icons that visually represent different human emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and love. 
These emojis are designed by adjusting facial features like eyes, eyebrows, mouth shape, and color to reflect specific emotional expressions.
This concept is widely used in messaging apps, social media platforms, virtual assistants, and AI systems to enhance digital communication by making text-based conversations more expressive, engaging, and human-like.
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
For a Facial Emoji Generation Based on Emotions project, commonly used technologies are:
Python – Main programming language
OpenCV – For image processing and face detection
TensorFlow / Keras – For training emotion detection model
NumPy & Pandas – Data handling
Matplotlib – Visualization
Flask / Django – To create a web application (optional)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript – Frontend (if web-based project)
Pre-trained models / CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) – For emotion classification
HOW THE PROJECT WORKS:
Capture image using webcam.
Detect face using OpenCV.
Predict emotion using trained CNN model.
Generate and display corresponding emoji based on detected emotion.
